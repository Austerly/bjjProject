				The author of this website, Austin Hesterly, is indebted to many people and organizations for his introduction into the Gentle Art.  Specifically David Ramos and the members Rexburg Jiu Jitsu Club of BYU - Idaho, Mark Massey of Elite Jiu Jitsu in Pocatello, Idaho, Jared Loper, and Drew Brandel of Eagle Rock Jiu Jitsu.  What a blessing it has been to learn from all of you.  Above all, though, thanks is due to a wonderful wife who tolerates her husband's passion in a pursuit that she does not understand.  Truly, anything is possible with a wonderful woman at your back.
